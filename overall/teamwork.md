# Working as a Team & Project Management
The Valve Team consisted of only three members and was thus the smallest team. Due to the small number of team members, no rigid structure was put into place; work was done colaboratively and it was easy to see where each team member was at any given point. Thus the responsibility of ensuring that the project was on task was given to all team members. This worked well with all of the main aims of the project identified in the initial project proposal fufilled. 

Communication between team members and other teams was performed using (Slack)[https://slack.com/], a tool used for communication within teams. We found that this worked especially well and we were able to incorporate slack bots which link Slack to other services that we used such as Google Drive, GitHub and Asana.
