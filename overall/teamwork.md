# Team Statement: How we worked
The Valve Team consisted of only three members and was thus the smallest team. Due to the small number of team members, no rigid structure was put into place; work was done colaboratively and it was easy to see where each team member was at any given point. Thus the responsibility of ensuring that the project was on task was given to all team members. This worked well with all of the main aims of the project identified in the initial project proposal fufilled. 

Early on, a decision was made to create a modular prototype. This greatly increased the efficiency of the team since each team member had a clearly designated task. However, work was done collaborately with more experienced members of the team lending a hand to less experienced members when required. 

Communication between team members and other teams was performed using [Slack](https://slack.com/), a tool used for communication within teams. We found that this worked especially well and we were able to incorporate slack bots which link Slack to other services that we used such as Google Drive, GitHub and Asana.

Asana was used for both time management and task management. All tasks which needed to be completed were placed on Asana and in certain situations, assigned to individuals so that they received email reminders. The timeline feature was used to create a Gantt chart and understand the overall project timeline.
